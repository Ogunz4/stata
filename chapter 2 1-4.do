  codebook gender
  *The first line lists the variable name, gender, and the variable label, Participantâ€™s gender. Next thetype of the variable, which is numeric (float), is shown. The range of this variable (shown as the lowest value and then the highest value) is from 1 to 2, there are two unique values, and there are 0 missing values in the 20 cases. This information is followed bya table showing the frequencies, values, and labels. We have 10 cases with a value of 1, labeled Male, and 10 cases with a value of 2, labeled Female.
  
   codebook education
   *Because this variable takes on more values, Stata does not tabulate the individual values. Instead, Statadisplays the range (8 to 20) along with the mean, which is 14.45, and the standard deviation, which is 2.95. Italso gives the percentiles. The 50th percentile is usually called the median, and here the median is 14.5.
   
   codebook conserv
   *he first line lists the variable name, conserv, and the variable label, political spectrum. Next the type of the variable, which is numeric (float), is shown. The range of this variable (shown as the lowest value and then the highest value) is from -9 to 5, there are 6 unique values, and there are 0 missing values in the 20 cases. This information is followed by a table showing the frequencies, values, and labels. We have 10 cases with a value of 1, labeled Male, and 10 cases with a value of 2, labeled Female.
